            <h2>What is field hockey?</h2>
            <p>
                Field hockey is a sport played on an artificial pitch. There are ten players on each team and one goalkeeper. It is played
                with a hockey stick and hockey ball and protective gear such as a gumshield and shin-guards. The aim of the game is to score in the opponents goal. The 
                winner of the game is determined by which team has scored the most goals. If the game ends in a tie it goes to penalties.
                This is when the goalkeeper starts at the goal, then the ball is placed at the 23m line that is nearest to the goal the goalie is in. The striker 
                stands outside this line, then the umpire blows the whistle and there is an official who starts the clock at an 8 second countdown. As soon as the 
                umpire blows the whistle the striker and goalie can move as they please. The strikers aim is to score in the goal before the 8 seconds are up.
                The penalty is finished when the 8 seconds are finished or the goal is scored or the goalkeeper or striker commits an offence. 
                Overall hockey is a very entertaining sport that has a lot of benefits and I enjoy playing it a lot.

            <h2> Getting involved </h2>

            <p>
                There are many clubs out there that will welcome beginners to the sport of hockey,
                and many of them can be found by searching the internet or contacting the local governing institutions.
                I began playing hockey at the age of 12 in my school as it was the main sport along with rugby. It's an easy
                sport to get make friends in and to pick up. There are also usually A teams and B and C and so on, so if you wanted to play more
                competitively you could just join the A team and if you wanted to play more for fun or social you could join the B or C team. Hockey has allowed me to make 
                friends outside of school and also improve many social and team-building skills. Training is usually on for most teams twice a week for example I trained mondays
                and thursdays from 6:30-8:30. At weekends there's usually a game these can be competitive or friendly games depending on whether your team is in a 
                league and the match can be played home or away. Winners of the league can get a cup or trophies and medals.

            <h2> Equipment </h2>

            <ul>
                <li>Hockey stick: When choosing a hockey stick it's best to go in person to shops and try out which one feels
                    best.
                    There are different lengths and choosing one that suits you best is important. There are also many different
                    brands to choose from such as Grays or Osaka. 
                </li>

                <li> Gear: Shin-pads and gum-shields are <b> very important </b> to protect your shins and teeth.</li>

                <li> Hockey ball: hockey balls are made of twine cork and covered with a strong plastic. You can get them with different colours and designs. </li>

            </ul>
