            <p> I've inserted some clips below to allow you to see what hockey being played looks like

            <ul>
                <li> This video shows a penalty corner. This is awarded to a team when the defender fouls a player on the
                    opposing team within the
                    shooting circle around the goal.
                    It can also be awarded if the defender intentionally hits the ball over the end line.
                </li>

                <li> The penalty corner is started when the attacker places the ball on the back line.
                    The penalty corner player must stand at least one foot outside the back line and can either push or
                    knock the ball into play. The ball cannot be lifted or lofted on purpose.
                </li>


                <li>
                    As we can see in the video 4 defenders are place in the goal with the goalie.
                    All of their feet and sticks must be behind the goalies line. Each defender wears a face-mask for
                    protection during the penalty
                    corner. The rest of defenders must be behind the 25 yard line. All the attackers must be standing on the
                    arc of the shooting circle and not allowed have their feet or sticks within
                    the circle. Once the ball has been hit or the play has begun and all other players are allowed move from
                    either the inside of the goal or the
                    halfway line.
                </li>

                <li>
                    A shot into the goal cannot be taken until the ball has left the shooting circle. Usually the player on
                    the end line pushes the ball towards the
                    attacker at the mt arc of the circle. As soon as a defender sees the ball move they usually run toward
                    the main attacker
                    who the ball is being pushed to to try defend the goal. The attacker will stop the ball outside the
                    circle to allow the next attacker
                    to strike into the goal. The ball must've gone outside the circle before that attacker could strike.
                </li>
            </ul>
