                <li>
                    Goalie: Their aim is to defend the goal. They are the only ones who can use body parts to defend as well
                    as their hockey stick

                </li>

                <li>
                    Sweeper: The sweeper is considered an extra defender who plays behind the defenders but in front of the
                    goalie.

                <li>
                    Defender: The defender is to defend the goal and keep it away from the goalie. They mark the forwards
                    and would aim to get the
                    ball back into the centre of the field to the midfielders so they can score or pass to forwards.
                </li>



                <li>
                    Midfielders: They are both defenders and forwards and are positioned mostly into the centre of the
                    field.
                    Midfielders need to be very vigilant as they need to be up and down the pitch constantly
                </li>


                <li>
                    Forward: these are the strikers of the pitch. Their main aim is to score in the opponents goal. They are
                    positioned in
                    front of the opponents goal
                </li>


            </ul>
